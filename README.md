# Project03
1. Extend all abstract classes into the appropriate concrete classes

2. In MesoAscii.java use code from the other two projects to allow you 
to calculate an ascii average from a given ID

3. In MesoEqual.java use code from the other two projects to allow you 
to read codes directly from Mesonet.txt

4. In MesoEqual.java make a hashmap containing the IDs that have the 
same ascii average

5. With the hashmap made in step 4, sort the ascii IDs in alphabetical 
order using a method made in StationLexicographical.java

6. profit!!
